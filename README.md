A modern, adaptive interface that provides an intuitive and pleasant user experience.
Simple and easy-to-understand forms were developed for registering new users and logging into existing accounts.
Each product is presented in the form of an informative card. It contains an image of the product, its name, price, and main characteristics.
For convenience in viewing a large number of products, were used two approaches:
1. Pagination which allows users to navigate between pages with products, which is especially convenient for detailed study of the assortment.
2. Scrolling through cards in the form of a carousel allows you to quickly familiarize yourself with recommended, promotional, or new products without leaving the main page.
THe key feature is its adaptability. The interface automatically adjusts to different screen sizes, whether it's a large monitor, tablet, or smartphone.
